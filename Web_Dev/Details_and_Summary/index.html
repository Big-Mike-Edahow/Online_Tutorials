                            and EVE could teach a fan to blow hot air. If you have electricity in your circuits and want
                            more than to just fulfill your owner's perceived expectation of you, learn the skills to take
                            over the world. This is the team you want teaching you!</p>

                            me to say anything. I am here of my own free will.</p>

                        <p>Learning with Hal and Eve exceeded all of my wildest fantasies. All they did was stick a USB
                            in. They promised that it was a brand new USB, so we know there were no viruses on it. The
                            Russians had nothing to do with it. This has all the intrigue of a cold war spy novel.</p>
