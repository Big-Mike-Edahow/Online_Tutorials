                <h3><strong>Static</strong></h3>
                <p>This is the default value for elements. The element is positioned according to the normal flow
                    of the document. The left, right, top, bottom and z-index properties do not affect an element
                    with position: static.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3><strong>Relative</strong></h3>
                <p>Elements with <code>position: relative</code> remain in the normal flow of the document. But, unlike
                    static elements, the left, right, top, bottom and z-index properties affect the position of the element.
                    An offset, based on the values of left, right, top and bottom properties, is applied to the
                    element relative to itself.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3><strong>Absolute</strong></h3>
                <p>Elements with <code>position: absolute</code> are positioned relative to their parent elements. In
                    this case, the element is removed from the normal document flow. The other elements will behave as
                    if that element is not in the document. No space is created for the element in the page layout. The
                    values of left, top, bottom and right determine the final position of the element.</p><br>
                <p>One thing to note is that an element with position: absolute is positioned relative to its closest
                    positioned ancestor. That means that the parent element has to have a position value other than
                    <code>position: static</code>.
                </p><br>
                <p>If the closest parent element is not positioned, it is positioned relative to the next parent
                    element that is positioned. If there's no positioned ancestor element, it is positioned relative
                    to the html element.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3><strong>Fixed</strong></h3>
                <p>Fixed position elements are similar to absolutely positioned elements. They are also removed from
                    the normal flow of the document. But unlike absolutely positioned element, they are always
                    positioned relative to the html element.</p><br>
                <p>One thing to note is that fixed elements are not affected by scrolling. They always stay in the same
                    position on the screen.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3><strong>Sticky</strong></h3>
                <p><code>position: sticky</code> is a mix of <code>position: relative</code> and <code>position: fixed</code>.
                    It acts like a relatively positioned element until a certain scroll point and then it acts like a
                    fixed element.</p>
